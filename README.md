## ü§î Solutions provided in the project

- Kanban Board App uses **modern React features** (Hooks, Context API)
- `<Kanban />` component uses **`useReducer`** hook, which allows to render `<Task />` component (data saved in the state) and all operations related to the board (adding/removing tasks, moving tasks, clearing the board)
- `<Kanban />` component provides **context** which is consumed by other components (e.g. `<Board />` which is consumer of `ColumnsContext`, in this case `useContext` hook is used)
- rendered `<Task />` are sorted by date
- `<Form />` component uses `useReducer` and `useState` hooks
    - `useReducer` to **control the form inputs** (entered values, marking fields filled in correctly/incorrectly, clearing the form)
    - `useState` to **store information about errors** after completing the form, which are then displayed to the user
- `<FormField />` are rendered dynamically, you can specify your own needed fields in the `formFieldsData.js` file

```javascript
const formFields = [
    { name: 'taskName', label: 'task*', type: 'text' },
    { name: 'owner', label: 'owner*', type: 'text' },
    { name: 'email', label: 'e-mail*', type: 'email' },
    { name: 'date', label: 'deadline', type: 'date' },
    { name: 'message', label: 'description', fieldName: 'textarea' },
];
```

- all **form fields are validated** according to the rules saved in the `DataValidator.js` file, e.g.

```javascript
owner = {
        regExp: /^[a-zA-Z]{3,}(?:(-| )[a-zA-Z]+){0,2}$/,
        err: 'min. 3 letters',
        required: true,
    };
```

- Kanban Board App columns are rendered dynamically as well, as specified in `columnsData.js` file

```javascript
const columnsData = [
    { id: 1, name: 'pending', limit: 6, isDivided: false },
    { id: 2, name: 'analysis', limit: 3, isDivided: true },
    { id: 3, name: 'development', limit: 5, isDivided: true },
    { id: 4, name: 'test', limit: 3, isDivided: false },
    { id: 5, name: 'deploy', limit: 5, isDivided: false },
];
```

- **custom hooks used**
    - `useStorage` to handle tasks data saving / deleting in Local useStorage
    ```javascript
        const [saveToStorage, getFromStorage] = useStorage();
    ```
    - `useModal` to handle `<Modal />` with specified content opening / closing when needed (showing `<Form />`, information about full column - no task move possibility, e.t.c.)
    ```javascript
        const [ModalWithContent, showModal, closeModal, setContent] = useModal();
    ```
- Kanban Board App styling
    - **RWD**
    - **pure CSS** with the use of variables (the ability to quickly change, for example, colors)
    - layout resembling a **board with pinned cards** (also showing tasks with due date shorter than that specified in the `importantDeadline.js` file - you can specify it on your own, by default it is 2 days, as above)
